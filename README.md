In this assignment, the name of the game is symmetric encryption.
Your objectives: Decrypt a symmetrically encrypted image file

Details:
You are given an encrypted image file and the following information
• The file has been encrypted using the python tool Fernet, which uses a
symmetric encryption algorithm. See https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/
• The key used the encrypt the image file has been made available to you. Use the
key to decrypt the file
Your clue: Both files have been base64 encoded. So it is recommended that you decode the bytes
after you read in the file. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html
Finally: Once you have decrypted the image, save it to file and open the image to retrieve the full
code. This full code must be entered to the VULA assignment page for your reward.
We hope you enjoy practical assignment 3, good luck!
